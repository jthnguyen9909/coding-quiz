# Coding Quiz

## Description

This is a coding quiz application built mainly using Javascript functionality featuring HTML, CSS, and Javascript code written by me. It features sound effects, a scoring system, as well as a highscore page where a user can save their scores and compare them to others'.

## Usage

The application can be started by clicking on the Start Quiz button. The user will then be asked a series of questions and a corresponding sound effect will play depending on whether the user chooses the correct answer. If an incorrect answer is chosen, some time will also be deducted from the timer counting down, and the quiz will end if the timer reaches zero or if there are no more questions. The questions list can be easily accessed and modified through the separate questions.js file, and the timer will scale based on the number of questions.
